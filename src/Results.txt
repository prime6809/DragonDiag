Interpreting the results.

This is an aid to faults with the Dragon / CoCo that *MAY* cause the tests to 
fail, and will serve as an indication as to what might be the cause of the 
fault.

Test 1 / pre-test 1 fail.

If the card displays the signon message on the LCD and then turns on all 8
status LEDS this indicates a failure of the Diag card's self test. (Uusally
the onboard RAM). If possible test the card in another machine to see if this
is the case.

If the card does not sign on the LCD this may indicate a failed CPU or SAM 
chip. The LEDs should be checked and the following may be indicated :

LED 	State	Possible fault
+5V	off	Power supply fault, sometimes worth wiggling power switch.
+12V	off	On a machine with 4K/16K RAMS, may prevent RAM from working.
halt	on	HALT line to the CPU stuck low, preventing the CPU running.
reset	on	RESET line stuck low.
E	off	No E clock to CPU.
Q	off	No Q clock to CPU.

If the E and Q leds are off but you are getting a picture on the screen, this
may indicate a break of the line somewhere between the SAM and the CPU. 

Halt or Reset lines being stuck low, may indicate a short of those lines to 
ground, or that the pullup resistor on those lines has failed.


Test 2 - machine setup and initialization of SAM/PIAs.

No failures tested as this is a setup stage.


Test 3 - Video RAM test.

A Display RAM failure will be indicated on the LCD display, and will be 
something like :-
"Failed at:$0400 w$00 r$08"

This means that the ram failed at address $0400, and that the value written
was $00, but read back was $08. From this we can determine that the fault 
lies with bit 3 of the RAM. Note for display RAM tests on a non CoCo 3, this
will always be in bank 0 of a machine with 4K or 16K rams.

A failure of the 74LS244, buffer chip that is between the CPU and RAM can
also cause this fault.


Test 4 - Quick RAM test.

Prease refer to notes for Test 3 Video RAM test. However it should be noted 
that for a machine with only one bank of RAM e.g. a 4K or 16K CoCo 1/2, if
the "single bank" dip switch is not set, this test will fail on trying to 
test the non-existant second bank of RAM.


Test 5 - RAM address test.

This test is carried out in 2 parts, first a single 256 byte page of RAM is 
filled with an ascending value, and then the values are read back. A failure 
can be caused by a broken address line between A0 and A7. 

The second part fills the entire 32K with an ascending value, incremented on
each page boundry, so the first page gets $00 written to it, the next page 
$10 and so on.

This will cause a later value to over-write an earlier one. By examining 
the values you can determine which address line is broken.

e.g. if A7 where broken, then it would fail at address $00, with the value 
$80 written. 

This test will generally fail at address $00, and the value written, ill tell
you which address line is possibly faulty. 

Value	Address line	Address line
	0..7		8..F
$80	A7		A15 (not tested!)
$40	A6		A14
$20	A5		A13
$10	A4		A12
$08	A3		A11
$04	A2		A10
$02	A1		A9
$01	A0		A8


Test 6 - ROM test.

If the ROMS are recognized their checksums and identities are displayed note
that having NONE or Unknown in the $8000-$9FFF area of a CoCo 1/2 may not 
indicate a failure, if the machine does not have Extended Colour Basic fitted.

In other cases check that the roms identified match what you would expect for
that machine. Note also that a DraCo machine in CoCo mode will find CB/ECB 
but find Dragon roms in Dragon mode.


Test 7 - PIA test.

A failure at this point may indicate a bad PIA, or possibly an address decoding
error (usually a failure of the 74LS138), the toggle test may be able to help
you determine this.


Test 8 - spurious interrupt test.

If any spurious FIRQ or NMI interrupts are displayed then this may indicate a 
short to one of the interrupt lines, or possibly a failure in the line's pullup
resistor.


Test 9 - Interrrupt test.

A failure in the NMI test may indicate a faulty NMI line on the CPU, or a break / 
short in the NMI line somewhere between the cartridge port and the CPU.

A failure in the FIRQ test may indicate a faulty FIRQ line on the CPU, it may 
also indicate a fault with PIA1, or with the lines between the cartridge port and
PIA1, or between PIA1 and the CPU.

The X1 LED should begin to flash at approximately 1Hz, if it does then the IRQ is
working. Failing to flash may indicate a faulty IRQ line on the CPU, it may 
also indicate a fault with PIA0, or with the lines between the 6847 VDG and
PIA0, or between PIA0 and the CPU.


Test 10 - Cartridge select signals.

A failure to trigger of CART / CTS or P2 /SCS may indicate a broken line between
the 74LS138 address decoder and the cartridge port, or that the lines is shorted
to ground or to +5V.


Test 11 - Long RAM test.

For details see test 3 and test 4.


Test 12 - Dragon 64 tests.

Check for expected ROM checksums for second ROM.
More extensive ACIA tests to follow, currently just dumps registers.


Test 13 - Upper RAM test.

For details see test 3 and test 4.


Test 14 - Dragon Plus test.

For details see test 3 and test 4, however a fail here may indicate a faulty RAM
on the Dragon plus board. Check that correct message is displayed on Dragon Plus
screen.


Test 15 - CoCo 3 tests.

Check for correct checksums for $C000-$DFFF and $E000-$FE00 ROMS.
RAM failure meaning will generally indicate which chip has failed, for a 128K 
CoCo 3 this will be one of the 64Kx4 RAMs on the mainboard, for expanded machines
this will indicate a chip on your expansion board.

 

General.

If the board boots but all tests seem to fail, or give unknown / bad results in the
case of the ROM and PIA tests, check the status of the DSD / SLENB line (pin 6 on 
the 74LS138) With no cartridge in the machine measure the voltage level on this line 
with the machine on, it should be close to 5.0V. This line is generally pulled up via 
a 4.7K resistor, so with the machine off the resistance between pins 6 an 16 of the 
74LS138 should be arrounf 4.7K.
